This is an important step for <br> combatting increasing clothing waste, along with indirectly reducing the impact fast fashion<br>has on the environment, by providing an alternative website for reselling.<br><br><br>Giving consumers the opportunity to donate any old clothing encourages them to learn about<br>the effects of fast fashion on the environment. With better knowledge, healthy consuming <br>habits can be made based on the environmental ethics of clothing. This is what we aim to<br>achieve, which has led us to building this website as a first step to solving the problem. <br><br><br>Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG 12) focuses on ensuring sustainable consumption and <br> production patterns.
